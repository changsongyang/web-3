Feature: Share by public link with different roles
  As a user
  I want to share files through a publicly accessible link with different roles
  So that users who do not have an account on my ownCloud server can access them

  As an admin
  I want to limit the ability of a user to share files/folders through a publicly accessible link
  So that public sharing is limited according to organization policy

  Background:
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes

  Scenario Outline: simple sharing by public link with different roles
    Given user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user creates a new public link for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI with
      | role | <role> |
    Then user "user1" should have a share with these details:
      | field       | value          |
      | share_type  | public_link    |
      | uid_owner   | user1          |
      | permissions | <permissions>  |
      | path        | /simple-folder |
      | name        | Public link    |
    And a link named "Public link" should be listed with role "<role>" in the public link list of folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    When the public uses the webUI to access the last public link created by user "user1"
    Then file "lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | role        | permissions                  |
      | Viewer      | read                         |
      | Editor      | read, update, create, delete |
      | Contributor | read, create                 |
