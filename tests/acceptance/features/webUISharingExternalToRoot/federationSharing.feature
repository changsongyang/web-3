Feature: Federation Sharing - sharing with users on other cloud storages
  As a user
  I want to share files with any users on other cloud storages
  So that other users have access to these files

  Background:
    Given app "notifications" has been enabled
    And the setting "auto_accept_trusted" of app "federatedfilesharing" has been set to "yes" on remote server
    And the setting "auto_accept_trusted" of app "federatedfilesharing" has been set to "no"
    And server "%remote_backend_url%" has been added as trusted server
    And server "%backend_url%" has been added as trusted server
    And server "%backend_url%" has been added as trusted server on remote server
    And server "%remote_backend_url%" has been added as trusted server on remote server
    And user "user1" has been created with default attributes on remote server
    And user "user1" has been created with default attributes
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI

  Scenario: test the single steps of sharing a folder to a remote server
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with remote user "user1" as "Editor" using the webUI
    And the user shares folder "simple-empty-folder" with remote user "user1" as "Editor" using the webUI
    Then as "user1" folder "/simple-folder (2)" should exist on remote server
    And as "user1" file "/simple-folder (2)/lorem.txt" should exist on remote server
    And as "user1" folder "/simple-empty-folder (2)" should exist on remote server

      | "user3@%remote_backend_url%" shared "lorem.txt" with you           |
    When the user accepts all shares displayed in the notifications on the webUI
    And the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then file "lorem (2).txt" should be listed on the webUI
    And as "user1" the content of "lorem (2).txt" should be the same as the original "lorem.txt"
    And folder "simple-folder (2)" should be listed on the webUI
